## How to connect javascript to html

Connecting JavaScript to HTML involves linking the JavaScript code with your HTML document so that the browser can execute the script. There are a few ways to do this, but the most common methods are using the `<script>` tag in the HTML document or linking to an external JavaScript file.

### Method 1: Inline JavaScript

You can include JavaScript code directly within the HTML document using the `<script>` tag. Place the script inside the `<head>` or `<body>` section of your HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
    <script>
        // Your JavaScript code goes here
        function myFunction() {
            alert("Hello, World!");
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>

    <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>

</body>
</html>
```

### Method 2: External JavaScript File

Create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) and link to it from your HTML file using the `<script>` tag.

**HTML file:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

    <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>

</body>
</html>
```

**JavaScript file (`script.js`):**

```javascript
// Your JavaScript code goes here
function myFunction() {
    alert("Hello, World!");
}
```

Make sure that the JavaScript file is in the same directory as your HTML file or provide the correct path in the `src` attribute.

### Best Practices:

1. **Place Scripts at the Bottom:** It's a good practice to include your scripts just before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure that the HTML content is loaded before the scripts.

```html
<!-- ... -->
<body>

    <!-- Your HTML content goes here -->

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. **Async or Defer Attributes:** When including external scripts, you can use the `async` or `defer` attributes to control how the script is executed. `async` loads the script asynchronously, and `defer` defers the execution until after HTML parsing.

```html
<script src="script.js" async></script>
<!-- or -->
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

Choose the method that best fits your needs and coding style.
