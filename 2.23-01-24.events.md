## Events in javaScript

In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as a user clicking a button, typing on the keyboard, resizing the window, or a webpage finishing loading. You can use JavaScript to respond to these events by attaching event handlers to specific elements or the document itself.

Here are some common events in JavaScript:

1. **Mouse Events:**
   - `click`: Triggered when the user clicks an element.
   - `mouseover`: Fired when the mouse pointer enters an element.
   - `mouseout`: Fired when the mouse pointer leaves an element.
   - `mousedown`: Fired when a mouse button is pressed over an element.
   - `mouseup`: Fired when a mouse button is released over an element.

   ```javascript
   const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

   button.addEventListener('click', function() {
       console.log('Button clicked!');
   });
   ```

2. **Keyboard Events:**
   - `keydown`: Fired when a key is pressed down.
   - `keyup`: Fired when a key is released.

   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
       console.log('Key pressed:', event.key);
   });
   ```

3. **Form Events:**
   - `submit`: Fired when a form is submitted.
   - `change`: Fired when the value of an input element changes.

   ```javascript
   const form = document.getElementById('myForm');

   form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
       event.preventDefault(); // Prevents the form from submitting in the traditional way
       console.log('Form submitted!');
   });
   ```

4. **Window Events:**
   - `load`: Fired when the entire page, including all assets, has loaded.
   - `resize`: Fired when the browser window is resized.

   ```javascript
   window.addEventListener('load', function() {
       console.log('Page fully loaded');
   });

   window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
       console.log('Window resized');
   });
   ```

5. **Custom Events:**
   You can also create and dispatch your own custom events.

   ```javascript
   const customEvent = new Event('custom');

   document.addEventListener('custom', function() {
       console.log('Custom event triggered!');
   });

   // Dispatch the custom event
   document.dispatchEvent(customEvent);
   ```
